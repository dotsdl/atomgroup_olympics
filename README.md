# atomgroup_olympics
Join us now for the bimillennial AtomGroup olympics!  Where proposed AtomGroup replacements battle for glory.

The incumbent!
 - MDAnalysis.core.AtomGroup.AtomGroup (old and tired, not expected to last the summer)

Proposed ideas:
 - pandas dataframe (young and inexperienced, many are writing him off already)
 - numpy structured array (the superstar, with many adoring fans)
